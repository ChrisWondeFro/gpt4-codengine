Setup and Overview:
Create an HTML page: Create a new text file and call it index.html. Open it with a text editor of your choice and paste the basic HTML structure into it.
Load Bootstrap via CDN or host it locally: You can load Bootstrap remotely or download and use Bootstrap locally. To load it remotely, paste the link to the Bootstrap CSS file in the <head> section of your HTML file. To load it locally, download the Bootstrap files, unzip them, and copy them into the same directory as your index.html file. Then, load the Bootstrap CSS into your project.
Include jQuery: Load the jQuery library either remotely or locally. You can find the link to the latest version of the jQuery library on the jQuery website.
Load Bootstrap JavaScript: Load the Bootstrap JavaScript library. It’s included in the downloaded version of the framework and you also find links to remote sources on the Bootstrap website. The JavaScript file should be loaded in the footer of your page, right after the call for jQuery.
Design your landing page:
Add a navigation bar: Use the navbar class to add a navigation bar to the top of the page.
Include custom CSS: Create a blank file with your text editor and call it main.css. Save it, then add it to the head section of your Bootstrap site. You can add custom CSS to your site to style the page background as well as the navigation bar and its elements.
Create a page content container: Add a container for the page content using the container-fluid class.
Add a background image and custom JavaScript: Use jQuery or JavaScript to make the image stretch all the way across the screen. Set a background image using CSS.
Add an Overlay: Create another div inside the <header> element you just created earlier.
Include a page title and body text: Add a page title in the form of a heading plus some body text.
Create a CTA button: Use Bootstrap’s pre-set classes to create a call to action button.
Set up a three-column section: Use Bootstrap’s grid system to create a three-column section for additional information.
Add a contact form: Use Bootstrap’s form classes to create a contact form.
Include a team section: Use Bootstrap’s card classes to create a team section, where you display team members and their positions in the company.
